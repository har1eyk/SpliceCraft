# SpliceCraft Changelog

---

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **CommercialSaaS (.dna) file import** — `File → Open` and the `o` hotkey
  now accept CommercialSaaS's native binary `.dna` format via Biopython's
  built-in parser. No manual GenBank export step required. Files are
  dispatched by extension (`.gb`, `.gbk`, `.genbank` → GenBank;
  `.dna` → CommercialSaaS), case-insensitively. Malformed `.dna` files
  produce a user-friendly error pointing to the likely cause.

### Fixed

- **Golden Braid primer validation** — `_design_gb_primers` now returns a
  clear error when the selected region is shorter than 18 bp, instead of
  silently producing a too-short primer with `Tm=0.0`. `_run_goldenbraid`
  surfaces that error in red in the results pane.
- **pLannotate race condition** — if the user loaded a different plasmid
  while pLannotate was still running, the worker would silently replace
  the newly-loaded plasmid with the merged old one. The worker now checks
  `self._current_record is record` before applying and drops the stale
  result with a warning.
- **Undo stack leaked across plasmid loads** — pressing `Ctrl+Z` after
  switching plasmids could yank the user back to an unrelated edit on
  the previous plasmid. `_apply_record` now clears undo/redo on a fresh
  load (fetch / file open / library pick). In-place record changes
  (pLannotate merge, sequence edits) keep their undo entries intact.
- **Wrap-around restriction sites** — enzymes whose recognition sequence
  spans the origin of a circular plasmid are now found and rendered as
  two linked pieces (labeled tail + unlabeled head). Previously those
  sites were silently invisible.
- **Zero-width feature click detection** — a malformed feature with
  `start == end` used to match every click on the backbone in linear
  view. The linear click handler now shares `_bp_in`'s half-open
  `[start, end)` semantics, making zero-width features unclickable.
- **Shrink-guard widened** — the data-safety guard now logs any library
  shrink (not just nukes to zero entries), making accidental entry
  deletion easier to audit in `/tmp/splicecraft.log`.

### Added

- **Feature deletion** — press `Delete` to remove the selected feature (annotation only,
  sequence is untouched); fully undo/redo-able with `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Shift+Z`.

- **Toggleable linear map view** — press `v` to switch the circular map panel between
  circular and horizontal linear views.  Linear view uses the same braille-pixel rendering
  with per-strand feature bars, arrowheads, lane stacking, and feature labels.

- **Strand-aware DNA sequence panel layout** — forward-strand features always appear
  *above* the DNA sequence line; reverse-strand features always appear *below*, making
  strand identity immediately apparent.  Overlapping features on the same strand stack
  into additional lanes on their respective side.

- **Braille feature bars in sequence panel** — annotation bars now use solid braille
  block characters (`⣿`) matching the aesthetic of the map viewer, with `▶`/`◀`
  arrowheads at the true start/end of each feature.

- **Single-bp feature triangles** — features that are one base-pair wide render as `▼`
  (above DNA) or `▲` (below DNA), pointing inward toward the sequence line.

- **Label-above / label-below layout** — feature names appear outside the bar (above the
  bar for forward features, below for reverse), keeping the braille bar itself clean.
  Multiple non-overlapping features share a single horizontal row pair.

- **Feature connector lines** (`l` key toggle) — draws a `┊` connector between each
  feature label and its braille bar in the sequence panel, and a dotted radial leader
  line from the arc to the label in the circular map.  Both panels respond to the same
  toggle.

- **Full NEB restriction enzyme catalog** — ~200 enzymes from New England Biolabs,
  including Type IIS (BsaI, BsmBI, BbsI, …) with non-palindromic cut sites.  Each hit
  is visualized as two distinct overlays:
  - **Recognition sequence bar** (`resite`) — thin braille arc outside the backbone for
    forward-strand hits, inside for reverse-strand hits; same strand-above/below layout
    in the sequence panel.
  - **Cut site marker** (`recut`) — `↓` (forward) or `↑` (reverse) arrow in the
    sequence panel; radial `┼` tick on the circular and linear map at the exact cut
    position.  Type IIS cut sites appear displaced from the recognition sequence as
    expected.
  - Recognition sequence IUPAC codes (R, Y, W, S, M, K, B, D, H, V, N) are handled
    via regex; both strands are scanned.  Enzyme labels appear in the circular map
    alongside regular feature labels using the same proximity placement algorithm.

- **Circular map: inside tick marks** — bp graduation marks and labels now sit *inside*
  the backbone ring rather than outside, keeping the outer ring clean for feature labels.
  Two constants (`TICK_DR_MARK`, `TICK_DR_LABEL`) control the inset depth and scale
  automatically with the `,` / `.` aspect-ratio keys.

- **Circular map: full-length feature labels** — removed the 16-character truncation;
  labels now display their full name.

- **Circular map: proximity label placement** — labels are placed as close to the arc as
  possible, greedy-stepping radially outward only when a label would overlap an
  already-placed one.  `LABEL_DR_MIN` (default `9`) sets the minimum clearance.

- **Default library entry** — MW463917.1 (pACYC184) is fetched and added to the library
  automatically on first launch.  The NCBI fetch dialog pre-fills with this accession.

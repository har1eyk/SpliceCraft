"""Cross-cutting sequence-integrity audit (2026-05-20).

Sacred invariants this file enforces:

1. **Length conservation on excise.** For a 2-cut digest on a circular
   plasmid: ``len(original) == sum(fragment.top_seq lengths)``. Every
   nucleotide accounted for exactly once. No silent duplication, no
   silent loss.

2. **Overhang-once-at-seam on ligate.** Ligating fragment A's right
   end to B's left end produces ``A.top_seq + B.top_seq`` — the
   overhang bases live in WHICHEVER fragment's top strand carried
   them (top-strand canonicalisation rule, splicecraft.py line ~4577).
   Verified by counting unique sequence motifs across the seam.

3. **Round-trip cut+religate = original** (modulo origin rotation).
   The strongest test: digest a known plasmid, religate the
   fragments, the result must be sequence-equal to the input under
   rotation.

4. **L0 → TU body conservation.** Each L0 part's body sequence appears
   exactly once in the assembled TU. Overhangs at part-part seams
   appear once (not twice).

5. **TU → MOD chain conservation.** Two TUs chained into an Ω-MOD:
   both TU bodies preserved, seam overhang once, MOD boundary
   overhangs at the outer cuts.

6. **Gibson overlap-merge.** N fragments with overlap regions →
   product length = sum(fragment_lengths) − sum(overlap_lengths).
   Overlap sequences appear ONCE.

7. **Traditional cloning round-trip.** Digest then religate must
   yield the original plasmid (under rotation).

8. **Entry-vector ops are read-only.** `_detect_entry_vector_role` /
   `_auto_bind_entry_vectors_from_entries` MUST NOT mutate the input
   record's sequence.

Sacred — never pick fragments by size (per
`feedback_never_assume_smaller_frag_is_payload`). Where the test
needs to identify the "insert" vs "vector" half, it uses feature
markers, not length comparisons.

        #   BsaI sites pointing OUTWARD. The site faces outward

        # after the A. So the bases NNNN are the 4-bp overhang of
        # the RIGHT fragment.
        # For body-to-have-(oh5,oh3): we want the LEFT BsaI cut to
        # leave oh5 as the right fragment's overhang (which becomes

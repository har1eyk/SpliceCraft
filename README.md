**A plasmid workbench you live in.** SpliceCraft is a terminal-native
viewer, sequence editor, primer + mutagenesis designer, Golden Braid /
MoClo cloning workbench, and in-process BLAST / HMMscan engine — all
rendered as crisp Unicode braille graphics in any modern terminal.
Fetch from NCBI, load `.gb` / `.gbk` files or `.dna` files from the
popular commercial plasmid editor file format (single or in bulk),
organize plasmids into named collections, design diagnostic /
cloning / Golden Braid primers via Primer3, run SOE-PCR site-directed
mutagenesis on any CDS, and search your own plasmid library by sequence
similarity — without ever leaving the shell.

**Built for daily lab work.** SpliceCraft is actively maintained by a
practicing bioengineer who uses it as their primary day-to-day tool for
plasmid design, cloning planning, and sequence triage. Bug reports come
from the bench; releases ship from the bench. Every feature has a
real-world job.

## Robustness is a feature, not an afterthought

A workbench you trust your day to has to behave like one. SpliceCraft
takes data safety and predictable behaviour as first-class design
constraints:

- **Four-layer data-safety net for every JSON write.**
  - Atomic write via `tempfile.mkstemp` + `os.fsync` + `os.replace`, with
    the prior version copied to `*.json.bak` first.
  - Rotating timestamped backups (`*.json.bak.YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`, last 10
    retained per file) so an *old* good copy is recoverable, not just
    the most recent.
  - Daily per-file snapshots to `<data dir>/snapshots/` (30 days
    retained) — written once per calendar day at launch.
  - Suspicious-shrink guard: if a save would discard >50% of entries
    (with ≥5 prior), the discarded entries are spilled to
    `<data dir>/lost_entries/` *before* the overwrite proceeds.
  - **Settings → Restore from backup…** surfaces every recoverable copy
    across all four tiers; pick a row, get a one-click restore (the
    pre-restore state goes through the same backup chain, so even an
    accidental restore is reversible).
- **Future-proof updates.** Every `splicecraft update` snapshots your
  full library, collections, parts bin, primers, feature library,
  grammars, codon tables, settings, crash-recovery autosaves, and
  `.dna` sidecars **before** invoking pip/pipx/uv/pixi. If the
  snapshot can't be taken (disk full, permissions), the upgrade
  aborts. Snapshots live in a sibling directory of the data dir, so a
  hypothetical recursive-wipe bug in a new version cannot touch them.
  - Roll back from a bad release with `splicecraft update --restore-pre-update latest` (or pick a specific snapshot id from `--list-snapshots`).
  - Pin to a specific working version with `splicecraft update 0.8.10` — the recovery escape hatch when a fresh release ships broken code.
  - The pre-update snapshot is itself reversible (a pre-restore snapshot is taken before any restore), so even an accidental rollback can be undone.
  - Launch-time update prompt: if the PyPI probe finds a newer
    version, SpliceCraft surfaces an "Install now? Yes / No"
    modal (default **No**) AFTER the splash screen dismisses — never
    during the splash, never in agent-API mode, never twice in the
    same session. The Yes path exits the TUI cleanly and runs the
    same `splicecraft update` flow (with the mandatory pre-update
    snapshot) in the same terminal. Every step of the updater path
    emits a structured `update.*` event for log-based diagnosis.
- **Crash-recovery autosave.** Dirty edits debounce a 3-second write
  to a per-record `.gb` snapshot. Power-cut your laptop mid-edit; the
  next launch surfaces the survivors.
- **2,400+ tests** (`pytest -n auto -q`, ~5 min on 8 cores) anchored on
  43 **sacred invariants** for biology correctness AND data integrity:
  palindromic-enzyme scanning, reverse-strand coordinate handling,
  IUPAC reverse-complement including ambiguity codes, wrap-around
  feature math, atomic-save contract, undo deepcopy, cache-deepcopy on
  read AND save, natural-sort row-mapping symmetry, etc. Property-based
  fuzzing (`hypothesis`) doubles up on the riskiest ones. Touching the
  biology primitives trips a test in under two seconds.
- **Wrap-feature correctness.** Origin-spanning features (CDSes /
  ori / regulatory elements that cross bp 0) are first-class
  citizens. `_feat_bounds` normalises every `CompoundLocation` to
  the dict-feature convention (`end < start` signals wrap), and
  every cloning / primer-design / annotation-transfer path routes
  through it — so a wrap CDS in pACYC184 designs the right primers,
  digests the right region, and transfers cleanly to a target.
- **Restriction scan off the UI thread.** Every keystroke, every
  settings toggle, every sequence replacement now dispatches the
  scan through a worker (`_dispatch_restr_scan`) instead of blocking
  the UI for 50–200 ms on big plasmids. Inputs (topology, min-length,
  unique-only filter) are captured at dispatch time so a record swap
  mid-scan can't poison the result.
- **Lock + concurrency hardening.** Lockfile PID is `fsync`-ed before
  acquire returns; stale-PID detection (`os.kill(pid, 0)`) lets a
  splicecraft killed on a shared filesystem release its lock on the
  next launch. Modal cap dispatches `callback(None)` on overflow so
  parent flows don't deadlock waiting for a result that never comes.
  Save / autosave workers deep-copy the record at entry so a
  concurrent feature-add can't leak partial state into a saved file.
- **No external BLAST install.** `pyhmmer` ships HMMER 3 source compiled
  in-wheel; BLASTN, BLASTP, and HMMscan all run in-process via
  `nhmmer` / `phmmer` / `hmmscan`, with a pure-Python ungapped fallback
  for queries too short for HMMER's profile builder. Zero external
  binaries; no PATH gymnastics.
- **Hardened input boundaries.** Centralised sanitisers strip control
  characters and Rich-markup metacharacters at every user-input boundary
  (modals, agent-API endpoints, NCBI fetch, bulk-import filenames). A
  hostile filename like `[red]EVIL[/red].dna` imports cleanly and
  renders as the literal characters in the panel and notifications.
  Modal-active gating keeps seq-cursor moves and selection slides from
  firing underneath active modals; CDS-divisibility gating prevents
  nonsensical AA strips on non-triple features; resite cuts carry baked
  per-strand offsets (no legacy schema crashes).
- **Refusal to start in a tiny terminal.** Below 100×30, SpliceCraft
  prints a friendly resize-and-retry message and exits with code 2
  rather than rendering a clipped, broken UI.
- **Bulk-import with per-file failure isolation.** The bulk
  importer (GenBank or popular commercial plasmid editor file format)
  caps per-file size at 50 MB, skips zero-length
  records, catches `OSError` / `PermissionError` / `struct.error`
  per-file, and dedups colliding ids by suffix. One bad file in a
  500-plasmid archive does not abort the batch.
- **Drift defenses.** Future-version JSON schemas load with a warning
  and a `.bak` rotation rather than crashing. Legacy schemas auto-
  rewrite on the next save. Migration code runs idempotently in
  `App.compose()` before any child mounts so the panel always sees a
  consistent state.
- **AI-parseable diagnostic logging.** Every user action (key binding,
  menu pick, button press, modal open, save / load / export) emits a
  single JSON-payload line at INFO level with ms-precision timestamp,
  8-char session id, originating `funcName:lineno`, and a structured
  payload:
  ```
  12:45:08.399 INFO splicecraft.action_fetch:53483 event app.fetch {"accession":"L09137","rec":"pUC19"}
  12:45:08.733 INFO splicecraft.fetch_genbank:6852 event op.timed {"path":"op.fetch_genbank","elapsed_ms":334.5}
  ```
  Heavy operations (NCBI fetch, primer3, Gibson simulate, restriction
  scan, pairwise align, fragment excise) self-tag with `op.timed` so
  bottlenecks surface immediately. `Alt+D` captures a UI snapshot;
  `splicecraft logs --bundle` packages logs + last 5 snapshots +
  scrubbed settings into a single ZIP for emailing. Sequence content
  is never logged — `SeqRecord` / `Seq` / `bytes` render as opaque
  size tags. The whole pipeline is level-gated for < 400 ns per call
  when INFO is suppressed.

> ⚠️ **Pre-release software.** SpliceCraft is under active
> development; the UI, on-disk file formats, and agent-API surface may
> evolve between releases. Your data files are auto-backed up to
> `*.bak` on every save, but please keep your own off-disk copies of
> anything critical. The maintainer treats it as their primary
> workbench — but it should not yet be a project's sole system of
> record.

## Quick start

```bash
pipx install splicecraft
splicecraft                      # empty canvas
splicecraft L09137               # fetch pUC19 from NCBI on launch
splicecraft myplasmid.gb         # local GenBank (.gb/.gbk) or .dna (popular commercial plasmid editor format)
```

`pipx` creates an isolated virtual environment for SpliceCraft and its
dependencies, so it won't clash with system Python packages. If you
don't have pipx yet: `sudo apt install pipx` on Debian/Ubuntu/WSL2,
`brew install pipx` on macOS, or `python -m pip install --user pipx`
elsewhere. User data lives in the platform-appropriate data directory
(see Installation).

Press `?` once running for the full keyboard-shortcut reference.

## What you can do without leaving the terminal

### View
- **Braille dot-matrix circular maps** — plasmids rendered as crisp
  Unicode braille rings with per-strand feature arcs, directional
  arrowheads, and proximity-placed labels. `v` toggles linear view.
- **Per-base sequence panel** with two-strand display, wrap-aware
  feature lanes, restriction-site overlays, and inline AA translation
  (one letter per codon midpoint, in the CDS's colour, with wrap-CDS
  support across the origin). Click an AA letter to highlight the
  codon's three bases on the strand.
- **Per-strand restriction-cut visualisation** — clicking a sticky
  cutter (EcoRI, HindIII, BsaI, BsmBI, BbsI, …) tints upstream bases
  blue and downstream red, with the staggered overhang showing as
  different colours on the two strands.
- **200+ NEB enzymes** including Type IIS scanners; toggle restriction
  overlays with `r`, filter to unique cutters / 6+ bp / connectors.

### Edit
- **In-place sequence edits** with full undo / redo (50-deep snapshot
  stack, deepcopied SeqRecord). Per-plasmid undo stashes — switch
  records, edit, switch back, undo history is restored.
- **Feature CRUD**: add / merge / split / delete / rename / recolor
  features; clipboard copies (top strand or reverse-complement bottom
  strand). Mouse-drag selects ranges; `Enter` highlights the smallest
  feature enclosing the cursor.
- **Crash-recovery autosave** writes a 3-second-debounced `.gb`
  snapshot to the data dir; survivors surface on next launch.

### Cloning
- **Cloning grammars** — GB L0 (Esp3I) and MoClo Plant (BsaI) ship as
  built-ins; user-defined grammars persist to `cloning_grammars.json`
  and are editable in `GrammarEditorModal`. The active grammar
  parameterises the Domesticator, Parts Bin, and Constructor — change
  enzyme / overhang / forbidden-site set without code edits.
- **Domesticator** — 4-source part picker (current map, library,
  Parts Bin, FASTA file). Auto-scrubs forbidden Type IIS sites in the
  CDS body via codon swap with cascade-prevention; primer tails follow
  the active grammar's pad / site / spacer / overhang.
- **Parts Bin** — domesticated parts catalog with per-grammar filtering;
  legacy parts default to GB L0; "Copy primed sequence" preserves the
  part's stored grammar. **Load Part** auto-classifies the currently-
  open plasmid by digesting it with each grammar's Type IIS enzyme and
  matching the released fragment's overhangs against the grammar's
  position table — register an externally-domesticated part without
  manually picking grammar / position.
- **Constructor** — multi-tab assembly UI: Traditional restriction
  cloning, Golden Braid / MoClo Type IIS assembly, and **Gibson
  assembly**. The Gibson tab stages N linear fragments, detects the
  longest exact-match overlap at every junction (incl. the wrap
  junction for circular topology), validates against a configurable
  minimum, and produces a single assembled product with each overlap
  appearing once. Reverse-orientation fragments surface a "did you
  mean to flip" hint instead of silently failing.
- **Traditional cloning** — restriction-digest + ligation simulator
  with three insert sources (current plasmid, library entry, free-form
  PCR product). 2-enzyme directional cuts produce both forward and
  reverse-orientation products; non-ligatable orientations are flagged
  rather than silently dropped. Save the simulated product back to the
  library with full **construction-history XML** (`<HistoryTree>`
  matching the popular commercial editor's format) so the lineage of
  multi-step builds is preserved across import/export.
- **Primer design** — detection / cloning / Golden Braid / generic via
  Primer3; primers can be added to the map as `primer_bind` features
  or saved to the persistent primer library (Designed → Ordered →
  Validated lifecycle).

### Mutagenesis
- **SOE-PCR site-directed mutagenesis** — design 4-primer SOE sets for
  any W140F-style point mutation. CDS source can be the loaded plasmid,
  a library entry, a Parts Bin part, or a free-form protein sequence
  (auto-optimised via the active codon table). Edge cases (mutation
  within 60 nt of a CDS end) auto-fall back to a 2-primer modified-outer
  PCR.

### Simulate
- **In-silico PCR + agarose gel** (Simulator menu) — design a primer
  pair against the loaded plasmid and the simulator enumerates every
  legal amplicon (exact-match binding model, wrap-aware on circular
  templates, capped at 50 results to flag mispriming runaway).
  Amplicons round-trip to the library as linear DNA entries with
  `primer_bind` features at both ends.
- **Agarose gel renderer** — paint up to 8 lanes (ladder / uncut
  plasmid / restriction digest / PCR amplicon) on a virtual gel at
  user-selectable agarose % (0.5 → 4.0). Mobility uses the Helling-
  Goodman-Boyer empirical curve (distance ∝ −log₁₀ bp within each
  agarose's resolution window) plus the standard form corrections —
  supercoiled migrates faster than linear, nicked / open-circle
  slower. Lane sources share the screen's template, so the amplicon
  designed in the PCR tab is immediately runnable in the Gel tab.

### Search
- **In-process BLAST** (`Ctrl+B`):
  - **BLASTN** (DNA → DNA) and **BLASTP** (protein → protein) via
    `pyhmmer.hmmer.nhmmer` / `phmmer` (HMMER 3 in-process at C speed);
    pure-Python ungapped fallback for queries below the HMMER profile-
    builder minimum (20 bp / 6 aa).
  - **HMMscan** reads any HMMER 3 `.hmm` / `.h3m` / `.h3p` file
    directly — point it at Pfam-A or any custom profile DB. Lazy file
    read so Pfam-scale (~1 GB) DBs don't pre-fetch into RAM.
  - DB build + search run in a `@work(thread=True)` worker; UI stays
    responsive on a 50-plasmid index. 4-entry LRU DB cache, auto-
    invalidated on `_save_collections`.
- **Six-frame ORF indexing** (opt-in checkbox) for BLASTP against
  unannotated regions of plasmid backbones.
- **Cross-collection plasmid search** — Edit → Find plasmid… opens a
  fuzzy / substring search over every plasmid in every collection,
  natural-sorted by `(collection, plasmid)` so `pBin2` lands before
  `pBin10`. One click opens the entry without manually switching
  collections.
- **Pairwise alignment of sequencing runs** — File → Align sequencing
  run loads a Plasmidsaurus `.zip` (or any `.gbk` / `.gb`), pairwise-
  aligns it against the loaded plasmid, and renders a full-screen
  alignment viewer with target-feature lane, parallel target/query
  rows, match track, and mismatch-red highlighting. Length-capped at
  200 kb per side; cancellable via the standard worker pattern.
- **New Plasmid modal** (`Ctrl+N`) — paste a sequence, optionally name
  + set topology, then either Create / Annotate-from-library
  (substring match) / Annotate-via-BLAST (≥90% identity → `misc_feature`).

### Library
- **Plasmid collections** — named buckets (e.g. "yeast project",
  "E. coli toolkit"); the panel toggles between a collection list and
  the active collection's plasmids. Atomic writes, `.bak` per change.
  Save the loaded record with `Ctrl+Shift+A`.
- **Bulk import a folder** — from the collections-list view, click `+`,
  type a name, and pick a folder via the embedded directory tree.
  Every `.dna` / `.gb` / `.gbk` / `.genbank` file inside is loaded
  independently into a new collection; failures are isolated per file
  and surfaced in a notify summary. Designed for migrating a
  popular-commercial-plasmid-editor archive in one shot.
- **`.dna` round-trip.** SpliceCraft reads the popular commercial
  plasmid editor's binary format (sequence + features + notes +
  primers + construction history) and writes it back — including the
  default `Primers` and `AdditionalSequenceProperties` packets the
  editor itself emits — so files round-trip through SpliceCraft
  cleanly into the editor's Viewer / Inspector panels. Imported
  primers feed into the persistent primer library (de-duplicated by
  sequence), and per-feature colours are recovered alongside.
  Construction history XML is preserved on import and synthesised on
  save for any product built via the Traditional cloning simulator.
- **Construction history viewer.** `File → View construction history`
  renders any record's `<HistoryTree>` lineage — fragments, enzymes,
  parent products — as a navigable tree so the provenance of a
  multi-step build is auditable at a glance.
- **Library fuzzy search** — subsequence match (case-insensitive,
  non-contiguous) against the visible table; natural-sorted so
  `pBin2` lands before `pBin10`.
- **Feature library** — reusable feature snippets (per-entry colour
  and strand) with a centralised browse / edit / rename / recolor /
  delete workbench. Display rows natural-sort independently of the
  on-disk order so `pPart-2` sits next to `pPart-10` rather than
  scattered alphabetically; entry indices remain stable across the
  re-sort so dirty-edit markers don't desync.

### Drive it from outside the GUI
- **Agent API** (`splicecraft --agent`, alias `--agent-api`) exposes a
  localhost JSON API with bearer-token auth, covering every GUI action
  external AI agents need. Launch SpliceCraft with `--agent` (override
  the default port via `--agent-port=PORT`) and any local AI coding
  agent — Claude Code, Cursor, aider, hand-rolled scripts — can drive
  the running session through the side-door without leaving its
  terminal. Sixty-plus endpoints across:
  - **Records** — get / set sequence, add / update / delete features,
    list features, find ORFs, transfer annotations.
  - **Files** — load (chromosome-scale safe via the path-based
    loader), export GenBank / GFF3 / FASTA (symlink-guarded), bulk
    import a folder.
  - **Library + collections** — list, search across collections,
    delete entries, create / rename / delete collections, set the
    active collection, list / set plasmid statuses.
  - **Parts** — list-parts, get-part, delete-part, classify-part
    (overhang-pair lookup against every grammar).
  - **Design** — gibson-assemble, simulate-gibson, design-mutagenesis,
    design-gb-part (Golden Braid / MoClo), design-primers (generic
    Primer3 detection or restriction cloning).
  - **Simulate** — simulate-pcr (exact-match in-silico amplification,
    wrap-aware on circular templates) and simulate-gel (per-lane band
    positions + optional rendered ASCII gel image; ladder / plasmid /
    digest / PCR-amplicon sources).
  - **Alignment** — diff-plasmid (circular rotation auto-detected),
    list-plasmidsaurus-members, align-plasmidsaurus-zip.
  - **History** — get-history returns the parsed `<HistoryTree>`
    lineage as nested JSON.
  - **Codon tables** — list, add (Kazusa fetch or raw dict),
    delete.
  - **Search** — blast, hmmscan.
  - **Data safety** — list-backups, restore-backup,
    list-pre-update-snapshots, restore-pre-update-snapshot.
  - **Settings** — get-settings, set-setting (allowlisted toggles).
  - **Utility** — check-primer-duplicates, capture-snapshot (writes
    a Markdown UI snapshot for bug reports), entry-vector CRUD.

  All write endpoints require the bearer token; all reads are
  unauthenticated to keep scripted introspection ergonomic. Inputs
  are length-, range-, and shape-validated at the boundary; paths
  that would write through symlinks are refused.
- **`splicecraft-cli`** — stdlib-only sidecar (~50 ms cold start) that
  reads connection details from `~/.local/share/splicecraft/agent_token`
  and drives the running GUI. Intended for Claude Code, Cursor, aider,
  hand-rolled scripts, or any external automation.

## Installation

Requires **Python 3.10+** and a terminal of at least **100×30**.

### With pipx (recommended)

```bash
pipx install splicecraft
```

`pipx` installs SpliceCraft and its deps (Textual, Biopython,
primer3-py, platformdirs, pyhmmer) into an isolated virtual
environment and places the `splicecraft` command on your `PATH`. This
is the right approach on modern Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and WSL2,
where `pip install` into the system Python is blocked by
[PEP 668](https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/).

If you don't already have pipx:

```bash
sudo apt install pipx                # Debian / Ubuntu / WSL2
brew install pipx                    # macOS
python -m pip install --user pipx    # everywhere else
pipx ensurepath                      # one-time; adds ~/.local/bin to PATH
```

### With pip inside a venv

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/splicecraft
~/.venvs/splicecraft/bin/pip install splicecraft
~/.venvs/splicecraft/bin/splicecraft
```

(Plain `pip install splicecraft` into system Python works on older
distros and inside conda envs, but is rejected by PEP 668 on any
recent Debian-family system — use `pipx` or a venv instead.)

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Binomica-Labs/SpliceCraft.git
cd SpliceCraft
pip install -e .                     # inside a venv
```

### User data location

User data (collections, library, parts, primers, features, codon
tables, settings) lives in the platform-appropriate data directory:

| Platform | Path                                          |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Linux    | `~/.local/share/splicecraft/`                 |
| macOS    | `~/Library/Application Support/splicecraft/`  |
| Windows  | `%APPDATA%\splicecraft\`                      |

Override with `SPLICECRAFT_DATA_DIR=/path/to/dir splicecraft`.

## Data files

All user data persists as human-readable JSON in the user data
directory; every save is atomic and writes a `.bak` first.

| File                            | Purpose                                                  |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `collections.json`              | Named collections of plasmids — source of truth          |
| `plasmid_library.json`          | Live mirror of the active collection's plasmids          |
| `parts_bin.json`                | Active parts-bin's user-domesticated cloning parts       |
| `parts_bin_collections.json`    | Named parts-bin snapshots (multi-bin storage)            |
| `primers.json`                  | Designed primer library                                  |
| `features.json`                 | Reusable feature snippets                                |
| `feature_colors.json`           | Per-type feature color overrides                         |
| `codon_tables.json`             | Cached codon-usage tables fetched from Kazusa            |
| `cloning_grammars.json`         | User-defined cloning grammars (Golden Braid / MoClo / custom) |
| `entry_vectors.json`            | Entry vectors bound to grammars (per `(grammar_id, role)`) |
| `settings.json`                 | App preferences (active collection, active grammar, …)   |
| `crash_recovery/*.gb`           | Per-record crash-recovery autosaves                      |
| `dna_originals/*.dna`           | Sidecars for round-tripping commercial-editor .dna files |
| `logs/splicecraft.log`          | Rotating per-session log (5 MB × 4)                      |
| `ui_snapshots/*.md`             | Alt+D bug-report dumps                                   |
| `snapshots/`, `*.bak.*`, `lost_entries/` | Four-layer JSON safety net (snapshots, rotating backups, shrink-guard spillover) |
| `../splicecraft-update-backups/` | Pre-update snapshots created by `splicecraft update`     |

The schema envelope (`{"_schema_version": 1, "entries": [...]}`)
silently accepts the legacy bare-list format (pre-0.3.1) and rewrites
it on the next save. Newer-version files load with a warning rather
than crashing.

## Tests

```bash
python3 -m pytest -n auto -q                  # full suite (2,400+ tests, ~5–6 min on 8 cores)
python3 -m pytest tests/test_dna_sanity.py    # biology correctness only (< 2 s)
python3 -m pytest tests/test_invariants_hypothesis.py  # property-based fuzzing
```

All tests run offline against synthetic `SeqRecord`s and monkeypatched
data paths; an autouse fixture in `tests/conftest.py` guarantees no
test can write to real user files.

## Codebase tour

SpliceCraft is a single-file Python app (`splicecraft.py`,
~39,000 lines) on Textual + Biopython. The single-file layout is
intentional — no import puzzles, everything is greppable from one
place.

`grep -n "^class \|^def " splicecraft.py` gives an authoritative live
map. Test files are 1:1 named after the subsystem they cover.

`CLAUDE.md` at the repo root is the **agent + contributor handover
document**: 43 sacred invariants, error-handling convention, known
pitfalls, persistence + cache discipline, natural-sort row-mapping
symmetry, the `.dna` writer's expected packet inventory. Read it before
touching the rendering layer, record pipeline, primer design, or any
persisted-data save path.

## Maintenance

SpliceCraft is actively maintained. The maintainer is a practicing
bioengineer running real cloning workflows in it daily; releases
typically go out the same week a problem surfaces at the bench. Issues
and PRs welcome at
[github.com/Binomica-Labs/SpliceCraft/issues](https://github.com/Binomica-Labs/SpliceCraft/issues).

**A plasmid workbench you live in.** SpliceCraft is a terminal-native
viewer, sequence editor, primer + mutagenesis designer, Golden Braid /
MoClo cloning workbench, and in-process BLAST / HMMscan engine — all
rendered as crisp Unicode braille graphics in any modern terminal.

Built by a practicing bioengineer for daily lab work. Bug reports come
from the bench; releases ship from the bench.

## Quick start

```bash
pipx install splicecraft
splicecraft                      # empty canvas
splicecraft L09137               # fetch pUC19 from NCBI on launch
splicecraft myplasmid.gb         # local GenBank or .dna
```

Press `?` once running for the full keyboard-shortcut reference.

See [`docs/install.md`](docs/install.md) for pip / uv / conda / source
installs and the user-data directory location.

## What it does

- **View** circular and linear braille-dot maps, per-base sequence
  panel with two-strand display, AA translation, restriction overlays
  (200+ NEB enzymes incl. Type IIS).
- **Edit** in-place with deepcopy undo / redo, feature CRUD,
  3-second-debounced crash-recovery autosave.
- **Clone** through a multi-tab Constructor (Traditional /
  Gibson / Golden Braid / MoClo / custom grammar) with a 4-source
  part picker. Every save path — L0 Domesticator, Constructor TU /
  MOD / L3+, Traditional cloning, Gibson, MoClo — lands as a single
  complete library entry (payload + overhangs + backbone) carrying
  every parent L0 / TU feature as its own annotation, so the L0 →
  TU → MOD provenance chain is browsable from the Library panel.
- **Design primers** via Primer3 (detection / cloning / GB / generic)
  with a persistent Designed → Ordered → Validated lifecycle.
- **Mutagenize** any CDS via SOE-PCR site-directed mutagenesis
  with edge-case fallback to 2-primer modified-outer PCR.
- **Simulate** PCR + agarose gels (0.5–4% with the Helling-Goodman-
  Boyer mobility curve and form corrections).
- **Align sequencing runs** from the Sequencing toolbar — drop in a
  Plasmidsaurus `.zip`, browse a nested 4-tab view of the run (General
  overview · per-Samples table · Quality metrics including k-mer +
  contamination + coverage · Align), pick a sample + target plasmid;
  the pairwise alignment lands as a sequencing-read lane on the
  linear map right next to the rail, and the target's library entry
  auto-tags to linear view for future opens.
- **Log experiments** from the Experiments toolbar — full-screen
  lab-notebook workbench with a split-pane layout: entries list on
  the left (Updated · Title with horizontal scroll for long titles)
  + full-width markdown `TextArea` editor on the right. Group
  entries into named **projects** (Ctrl+P → Projects… picker:
  Open / New / Rename / Duplicate / Delete) — projects are to
  experiments what plasmid collections are to plasmids. In-editor
  colored cross-references — `@<plasmid>` (lime), `!<action>`
  (purple), `&<gel>` (orange) — backspace deletes the whole tag,
  and **Ctrl+G or double-click on a tag opens its source modal
  focused on that entry**. Persistent
  `experiments.json` + `experiment_projects.json` + `gels.json`,
  per-entry image attachments (file picker on Linux/WSL · Pillow
  clipboard grab on Win/Mac), and F7 spellcheck via
  `pyspellchecker` with a user-maintained custom dictionary.
- **Save Simulator gels** from the `Simulator → Gel → Library`
  button — name + save the current lane layout + agarose %, load
  it back later, or reference it as `&<id>` in an Experiments
  entry.
- **Search** your library with in-process BLASTN / BLASTP / HMMscan
  (via `pyhmmer` — no external `blast+` install).
- **Drive from outside** via a 60+ endpoint localhost JSON API
  (`splicecraft --agent`) and a stdlib-only CLI sidecar
  (`splicecraft-cli`).

## Robustness is a feature

- **Four-layer JSON safety net** per save: atomic write + `.bak` +
  rotating timestamped backups + daily snapshots + suspicious-shrink
  guard.
- **Pre-update snapshots** before any pip / pipx / uv subprocess; stored
  in a sibling directory so a hypothetical recursive-wipe bug in a new
  version cannot kill recovery.
- **2,600+ tests** anchored on 41 sacred invariants (see
  [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md)), hypothesis property-based fuzzing on
  biology primitives.
- **Defence-in-depth size caps** on every external input (NCBI / PyPI
  / Kazusa fetch, `.dna` history packets, JSON saves, agent-API
  bodies, CLI responses).
- **Lock-file PID-fsync + stale-PID detection** so a SpliceCraft
  killed on a shared filesystem releases its lock on next launch.
- **Master Delete** under File → "⚠ Master Delete (wipe all user
  data)…" lets you wipe every plasmid, collection, experiment, gel,
  primer, part, grammar, codon table, feature, setting, backup,
  snapshot, and pre-update recovery copy in one go — true clean
  slate. Triple-gated: typed `YES` (case-sensitive) to enable the
  Delete button, then a default-No confirm with a 3-second cool-down
  on the destructive button. No keyboard shortcut. No agent endpoint.

## Tests

```bash
python3 -m pytest -n auto -q                  # full suite (~5–6 min on 8 cores)
python3 -m pytest tests/test_dna_sanity.py    # biology correctness only (< 2 s)
python3 -m pytest tests/test_perf_regression.py  # perf gates (~3 s)
```

All tests run offline against synthetic `SeqRecord`s and monkeypatched
data paths; the autouse `_protect_user_data` fixture in
`tests/conftest.py` guarantees no test can write to real user files.

## Maintenance

SpliceCraft is actively maintained. The maintainer is a practicing
bioengineer running real cloning workflows in it daily; releases
typically go out the same week a problem surfaces at the bench. Issues
and PRs welcome at
[github.com/Binomica-Labs/SpliceCraft/issues](https://github.com/Binomica-Labs/SpliceCraft/issues).

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a non-trivial
PR — it walks through the sacred invariants, the test cadence, and
the security-sensitive code surfaces.

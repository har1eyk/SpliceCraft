**A plasmid workbench you live in.** SpliceCraft is a terminal-native
viewer, sequence editor, primer + mutagenesis designer, Golden Braid /
MoClo cloning workbench, and in-process BLAST / HMMscan engine — all
rendered as crisp Unicode braille graphics in any modern terminal.

Built by a practicing bioengineer for daily lab work. Bug reports come
from the bench; releases ship from the bench.

## Quick start

```bash
pipx install splicecraft
splicecraft                      # empty canvas
splicecraft L09137               # fetch pUC19 from NCBI on launch
splicecraft myplasmid.gb         # local GenBank or .dna
```

Press `?` once running for the full keyboard-shortcut reference.

See [`docs/install.md`](docs/install.md) for pip / uv / conda / source
installs and the user-data directory location.

## What it does

- **View** circular and linear braille-dot maps, per-base sequence
  panel with two-strand display, AA translation, restriction overlays
  (200+ NEB enzymes incl. Type IIS).
- **Edit** in-place with deepcopy undo / redo, feature CRUD,
  3-second-debounced crash-recovery autosave.
- **Clone** through a multi-tab Constructor (Traditional /
  Gibson / Golden Braid / MoClo / custom grammar) with a 4-source
  part picker.
- **Design primers** via Primer3 (detection / cloning / GB / generic)
  with a persistent Designed → Ordered → Validated lifecycle.
- **Mutagenize** any CDS via SOE-PCR site-directed mutagenesis
  with edge-case fallback to 2-primer modified-outer PCR.
- **Simulate** PCR + agarose gels (0.5–4% with the Helling-Goodman-
  Boyer mobility curve and form corrections).
- **Search** your library with in-process BLASTN / BLASTP / HMMscan
  (via `pyhmmer` — no external `blast+` install).
- **Drive from outside** via a 60+ endpoint localhost JSON API
  (`splicecraft --agent`) and a stdlib-only CLI sidecar
  (`splicecraft-cli`).

## Robustness is a feature

- **Four-layer JSON safety net** per save: atomic write + `.bak` +
  rotating timestamped backups + daily snapshots + suspicious-shrink
  guard.
- **Pre-update snapshots** before any pip / pipx / uv subprocess; stored
  in a sibling directory so a hypothetical recursive-wipe bug in a new
  version cannot kill recovery.
- **2,600+ tests** anchored on 41 sacred invariants (see
  [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md)), hypothesis property-based fuzzing on
  biology primitives.
- **Defence-in-depth size caps** on every external input (NCBI / PyPI
  / Kazusa fetch, `.dna` history packets, JSON saves, agent-API
  bodies, CLI responses).
- **Lock-file PID-fsync + stale-PID detection** so a SpliceCraft
  killed on a shared filesystem releases its lock on next launch.

## Tests

```bash
python3 -m pytest -n auto -q                  # full suite (~5–6 min on 8 cores)
python3 -m pytest tests/test_dna_sanity.py    # biology correctness only (< 2 s)
python3 -m pytest tests/test_perf_regression.py  # perf gates (~3 s)
```

All tests run offline against synthetic `SeqRecord`s and monkeypatched
data paths; the autouse `_protect_user_data` fixture in
`tests/conftest.py` guarantees no test can write to real user files.

## Maintenance

SpliceCraft is actively maintained. The maintainer is a practicing
bioengineer running real cloning workflows in it daily; releases
typically go out the same week a problem surfaces at the bench. Issues
and PRs welcome at
[github.com/Binomica-Labs/SpliceCraft/issues](https://github.com/Binomica-Labs/SpliceCraft/issues).

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a non-trivial
PR — it walks through the sacred invariants, the test cadence, and
the security-sensitive code surfaces.

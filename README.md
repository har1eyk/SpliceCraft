A terminal-based circular plasmid map viewer, sequence editor, **primer design
workbench**, and **Golden Braid parts domesticator** — rendered entirely in your
shell. Fetch any GenBank record by accession, load local files, organize plasmids
into named **collections**, design diagnostic / cloning / Golden Braid primers
with Primer3, run **SOE-PCR site-directed mutagenesis** on any CDS, and edit
sequences — without ever leaving the terminal.

## Quick start

> ⚠️ **Beta software.** SpliceCraft is under active development and the API,
> UI, and on-disk file formats may change between releases. Your data files
> (`plasmid_library.json`, `parts_bin.json`, `primers.json`) are auto-backed
> up to `*.bak` on every save, but please keep your own off-disk copies of
> anything critical. **Do not use SpliceCraft as your sole system of record
> for cloning work until it exits beta.**

```bash
pipx install splicecraft
splicecraft              # empty canvas
splicecraft L09137       # fetch pUC19 from NCBI
splicecraft myplasmid.gb # open a local GenBank (.gb/.gbk) or CommercialSaaS (.dna) file
```

**That's it.** `pipx` creates an isolated virtual environment for SpliceCraft
and its dependencies, so it won't clash with system Python packages. If you
don't have pipx yet: `sudo apt install pipx` on Debian/Ubuntu/WSL2,
`brew install pipx` on macOS, or `python -m pip install --user pipx` elsewhere.
User data lives in the platform-appropriate data directory (see the
Installation section below).

## Features

### Core visualization & editing
- **Braille dot-matrix circular map** — plasmids rendered as crisp Unicode braille
  rings with per-strand feature arcs, directional arrowheads, and proximity-placed
  labels
- **Linear map view** — toggle with `v` for a horizontal strip layout
- **Dithered sequence panel** — per-base DNA viewer with feature bars, restriction
  site overlays, and double-stranded display
- **Inline amino-acid translation** — every CDS shows its protein right above
  (forward) or below (reverse) its DNA bar, one letter per codon midpoint, in
  the feature's colour. Wrap-around CDSes translate correctly across the origin.
  Click an AA letter to highlight that codon's three bases on the strand —
  `Ctrl+C` copies the codon
- **Per-strand restriction-cut visualization** — clicking a sticky cutter
  (EcoRI, HindIII, …) tints the upstream bases blue and downstream bases red,
  with the staggered overhang shown as different colours on the two strands
- **Live NCBI fetch** — pull any GenBank record by accession number on demand
- **Local file support** — open `.gb` / `.gbk` (GenBank) or `.dna` (CommercialSaaS native) files directly from disk
- **Free rotation** — spin the origin with `[` / `]` or arrow keys (when the map has focus)
- **Restriction enzyme overlay** — 200+ NEB enzymes including Type IIS
  (BsaI, BsmBI, BbsI, SapI) with visible recognition arcs + cut markers

### Libraries (all persist to JSON)
- **Plasmid collections** — organize plasmids into named buckets (e.g. "yeast
  project", "E. coli toolkit"). Library panel toggles between a collection list
  and the active collection's plasmids; a default "Main Collection" is created
  on first run, with full add / remove / rename CRUD from the panel
- **Plasmid library** — auto-saves on import, mirrors live into the active
  collection, survives restarts, rename + handslip-protected delete; unsaved
  edits prompt Save / Discard / Cancel before navigating away
- **Library fuzzy search** — type into the search box at the top of the
  library panel to filter the visible table by subsequence match (case-insensitive,
  not necessarily contiguous). Empty submit restores the full list.
- **Parts Bin** — Golden Braid L0 parts catalog with user-domesticated parts
  including sequences and primer pairs
- **Primer library** — all designed primers with Tm, length, date, status
  (Designed / Ordered / Validated), multi-select for batch operations
- **Feature library** — reusable feature snippets with per-entry color and strand,
  centralized workbench for browse / edit / rename / recolor / delete

### Primer design (Primer3)
- **Detection primers** — diagnostic PCR; Primer3 picks the ideal pair within
  a selected region, 450-550 bp product by default (configurable)
- **Cloning primers** — RE-site tails + GCGC padding; 30+ common enzymes or
  type a custom recognition sequence
- **Golden Braid primers** — Esp3I / BsmBI domestication for all L0
  positions (Promoter, 5' UTR, CDS, CDS-NS, C-tag, Terminator). Splitting
  L0 (Esp3I) from L1 (BsaI) lets domesticated parts survive the L1
  Golden Gate reaction without re-cutting.
- **Generic primers** — simple binding primers, no tails
- Primers can be added to the plasmid map as `primer_bind` features
- Scrollable `TextArea` for custom sequence input; highlighted text = target

### Mutagenesis
- **SOE-PCR site-directed mutagenesis** — design 4-primer SOE sets for any
  W140F-style mutation. CDS source can be the loaded plasmid, a library entry,
  a domesticated part from the Parts Bin, or a free-form protein sequence
  (auto-optimized to the active codon table). Edge cases (mutation within
  60 nt of a CDS end) auto-fall back to a 2-primer modified-outer PCR.

### Feature operations
- **Feature sidebar** — click a row to highlight on map; click the map to
  select the feature under the cursor
- **Undo/redo** — 50-deep snapshot stack for all sequence edits
- **Delete protection** — focus-aware Delete key; confirmation modal (default
  focus = No) for library entries
- **Clipboard** — OSC-52 copy works in Windows Terminal, iTerm2, modern WSL

### Data safety
- **Atomic saves** — all JSON files written via tempfile + `os.replace`
- **Automatic backups** — every save writes `*.json.bak` before overwriting
- **Corrupt-file recovery** — missing files don't crash; corrupt files auto-
  restore from `.bak` with a warning notification on startup

## Installation

Requires **Python 3.10+**.

### With pipx (recommended)

```bash
pipx install splicecraft
```

`pipx` installs SpliceCraft (and its Textual / Biopython / primer3-py /
platformdirs deps) into an isolated virtual environment and places the
`splicecraft` command on your `PATH`. This is the right approach on
modern Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and WSL2, where `pip install` into the
system Python is blocked by [PEP 668](https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/).

If you don't already have pipx:

```bash
sudo apt install pipx           # Debian / Ubuntu / WSL2
brew install pipx               # macOS
python -m pip install --user pipx  # everywhere else
pipx ensurepath                 # one-time; adds ~/.local/bin to PATH
```

### With pip inside a venv

If you prefer a plain pip workflow, use a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/splicecraft
~/.venvs/splicecraft/bin/pip install splicecraft
~/.venvs/splicecraft/bin/splicecraft
```

(Plain `pip install splicecraft` into system Python works on older
distros and inside conda envs, but will be rejected by PEP 668 on any
recent Debian-family system — use `pipx` or a venv instead.)

### User data location

User data (library, parts bin, primers) lives in the platform-appropriate
data directory:

  | Platform | Path |
  |---|---|
  | Linux   | `~/.local/share/splicecraft/` |
  | macOS   | `~/Library/Application Support/splicecraft/` |
  | Windows | `%APPDATA%\splicecraft\` |

Override with `SPLICECRAFT_DATA_DIR=/path/to/dir splicecraft`.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Binomica-Labs/SpliceCraft.git
cd SpliceCraft
pip install -e .        # inside a venv, or pass --break-system-packages
```

---

## Usage

```bash
splicecraft              # empty canvas
splicecraft L09137       # fetch pUC19 from NCBI on launch
splicecraft myplasmid.gb # open a local GenBank (.gb/.gbk) or CommercialSaaS (.dna) file
splicecraft --version    # print version
splicecraft --help       # quick usage hint
```

If running from a git clone (`pip install -e .`), the same commands work;
you can also still run `python3 splicecraft.py` directly.

## Data files

All user data persists as human-readable JSON in the platform-appropriate user
data directory:

| File                       | Purpose                                                  |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `collections.json`         | Named collections of plasmids; source of truth           |
| `plasmid_library.json`     | Live mirror of the active collection's plasmids          |
| `parts_bin.json`           | User-domesticated Golden Braid parts                     |
| `primers.json`             | Designed primer library                                  |
| `features.json`            | Reusable feature snippets                                |
| `feature_colors.json`      | Per-type feature color overrides                         |
| `codon_tables.json`        | Cached codon-usage tables fetched from Kazusa            |
| `cloning_grammars.json`    | User-defined cloning grammars (Golden Braid / MoClo)     |
| `settings.json`            | App preferences (active collection, active grammar, ...) |
| `*.json.bak`               | Automatic backup — written before each save              |

A manual backup rotation happens on every save so accidental data loss is
always recoverable via the `.bak` file.

---

## Tests

```bash
python3 -m pytest -n auto -q                  # full suite (1,009 tests, ~2 min on 8 cores)
python3 -m pytest tests/test_dna_sanity.py    # biology correctness only (< 2s)
```

---

## Codebase tour

SpliceCraft is a single-file Python app (`splicecraft.py`, ~17,900 lines) built on
Textual + Biopython. The single-file layout is intentional — no import puzzles,
and everything is greppable from one place.

### Layout at a glance

| Region | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| Top of file | imports, user data dir (`platformdirs`), rotating session-tagged logger, `_safe_save_json` / `_safe_load_json` (atomic writes + `.bak` recovery) |
| Persistence | Library + parts-bin + primers + features + feature-colors + codon-tables + cloning-grammars + settings + **collections** (collection-driven model with active-pointer in settings.json + library mirror sync) |
| Biology core | NEB enzyme catalog, IUPAC-aware `_rc`, `_scan_restriction_sites` (palindrome- and wrap-aware), sequence panel renderer, `_translate_cds` |
| I/O | `fetch_genbank` (NCBI Entrez), `load_genbank` (`.gb` / `.gbk` / `.dna`), GenBank/FASTA export |
| Rendering | `_Canvas` + `_BrailleCanvas` (sub-cell dot matrix), `PlasmidMap`, `SequencePanel`, `FeatureSidebar`, `LibraryPanel` (two-mode: collections list ↔ active-collection plasmids), `MenuBar` |
| Workbenches | `PrimerDesignScreen` (detection / cloning / Golden Braid / generic), `MutagenizeModal` (SOE-PCR; 4-source CDS picker), `DomesticatorModal` + `ConstructorModal` (Golden Braid L0), `FeatureLibraryScreen` |
| Registries | codon-usage tables, parts bin, primer library, feature library, cloning grammars, plasmid collections — all persisted as JSON with automatic `.bak` backups |
| Controller | `PlasmidApp` — keybindings, undo/redo (50-deep snapshot stack), `@work` threads for NCBI / Kazusa, collection-driven startup migration in `compose()` |

### Contributor docs

`CLAUDE.md` at the repo root is the **agent + contributor handover document**.
It covers the 10 sacred invariants (biology correctness rules with test coverage),
the error-handling convention, performance notes, and modular recipes for adding
modals, workers, menus, or persisted libraries without tripping the invariants.
Read it before touching the rendering layer, record pipeline, or primer design.

### Running the suite

```bash
python3 -m pytest -n auto -q                  # full suite (~2 min)
python3 -m pytest tests/test_dna_sanity.py    # biology only (< 2 s)
```

All tests run offline against synthetic `SeqRecord`s and monkeypatched data paths;
an autouse fixture in `tests/conftest.py` guarantees no test can write to real
user files.

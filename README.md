**A plasmid workbench you live in.** SpliceCraft is a terminal-native
viewer, sequence editor, primer + mutagenesis designer, Golden Braid /
MoClo cloning workbench, and in-process BLAST / HMMscan engine — all
rendered as crisp Unicode braille graphics in any modern terminal.
Fetch from NCBI, load `.gb` / `.gbk` files or `.dna` files from the
popular commercial plasmid editor file format (single or in bulk),
organize plasmids into named collections, design diagnostic /
cloning / Golden Braid primers via Primer3, run SOE-PCR site-directed
mutagenesis on any CDS, and search your own plasmid library by sequence
similarity — without ever leaving the shell.

**Built for daily lab work.** SpliceCraft is actively maintained by a
practicing bioengineer who uses it as their primary day-to-day tool for
plasmid design, cloning planning, and sequence triage. Bug reports come
from the bench; releases ship from the bench. Every feature has a
real-world job.

## Robustness is a feature, not an afterthought

A workbench you trust your day to has to behave like one. SpliceCraft
takes data safety and predictable behaviour as first-class design
constraints:

- **Atomic writes with on-disk backups.** Every `*.json` library file
  goes through `tempfile.mkstemp` + `os.fsync` + `os.replace`, with the
  prior version copied to `*.json.bak` *before* the new write lands.
  Mid-process crash, full-disk error, or hand-edit gone wrong — the
  panel re-loads from `.bak` on next launch with a corruption-recovery
  toast.
- **Crash-recovery autosave.** Dirty edits debounce a 3-second write
  to a per-record `.gb` snapshot. Power-cut your laptop mid-edit; the
  next launch surfaces the survivors.
- **1,200+ tests** (`pytest -n auto -q`, ~3 min on 8 cores) anchored on
  ten **sacred invariants** for biology correctness: palindromic-enzyme
  scanning, reverse-strand coordinate handling, IUPAC reverse-complement
  including ambiguity codes, wrap-around feature math, atomic-save
  contract, undo deepcopy, etc. Property-based fuzzing
  (`hypothesis`) doubles up on the riskiest ones. Touching the biology
  primitives trips a test in under two seconds.
- **No external BLAST install.** `pyhmmer` ships HMMER 3 source compiled
  in-wheel; BLASTN, BLASTP, and HMMscan all run in-process via
  `nhmmer` / `phmmer` / `hmmscan`, with a pure-Python ungapped fallback
  for queries too short for HMMER's profile builder. Zero external
  binaries; no PATH gymnastics.
- **Hardened input boundaries.** Centralised sanitisers strip control
  characters and Rich-markup metacharacters at every user-input boundary
  (modals, agent-API endpoints, NCBI fetch, bulk-import filenames). A
  hostile filename like `[red]EVIL[/red].dna` imports cleanly and
  renders as the literal characters in the panel and notifications.
  Modal-active gating keeps seq-cursor moves and selection slides from
  firing underneath active modals; CDS-divisibility gating prevents
  nonsensical AA strips on non-triple features; resite cuts carry baked
  per-strand offsets (no legacy schema crashes).
- **Refusal to start in a tiny terminal.** Below 100×30, SpliceCraft
  prints a friendly resize-and-retry message and exits with code 2
  rather than rendering a clipped, broken UI.
- **Bulk-import with per-file failure isolation.** The bulk
  importer (GenBank or popular commercial plasmid editor file format)
  caps per-file size at 50 MB, skips zero-length
  records, catches `OSError` / `PermissionError` / `struct.error`
  per-file, and dedups colliding ids by suffix. One bad file in a
  500-plasmid archive does not abort the batch.
- **Drift defenses.** Future-version JSON schemas load with a warning
  and a `.bak` rotation rather than crashing. Legacy schemas auto-
  rewrite on the next save. Migration code runs idempotently in
  `App.compose()` before any child mounts so the panel always sees a
  consistent state.

> ⚠️ **Beta software.** SpliceCraft is under active development; the
> UI, on-disk file formats, and agent-API surface may evolve between
> releases. Your data files are auto-backed up to `*.bak` on every
> save, but please keep your own off-disk copies of anything critical.
> The maintainer treats it as their primary workbench — but it should
> not yet be a project's sole system of record.

## Quick start

```bash
pipx install splicecraft
splicecraft                      # empty canvas
splicecraft L09137               # fetch pUC19 from NCBI on launch
splicecraft myplasmid.gb         # local GenBank (.gb/.gbk) or .dna (popular commercial plasmid editor format)
```

`pipx` creates an isolated virtual environment for SpliceCraft and its
dependencies, so it won't clash with system Python packages. If you
don't have pipx yet: `sudo apt install pipx` on Debian/Ubuntu/WSL2,
`brew install pipx` on macOS, or `python -m pip install --user pipx`
elsewhere. User data lives in the platform-appropriate data directory
(see Installation).

Press `?` once running for the full keyboard-shortcut reference.

## What you can do without leaving the terminal

### View
- **Braille dot-matrix circular maps** — plasmids rendered as crisp
  Unicode braille rings with per-strand feature arcs, directional
  arrowheads, and proximity-placed labels. `v` toggles linear view.
- **Per-base sequence panel** with two-strand display, wrap-aware
  feature lanes, restriction-site overlays, and inline AA translation
  (one letter per codon midpoint, in the CDS's colour, with wrap-CDS
  support across the origin). Click an AA letter to highlight the
  codon's three bases on the strand.
- **Per-strand restriction-cut visualisation** — clicking a sticky
  cutter (EcoRI, HindIII, BsaI, BsmBI, BbsI, …) tints upstream bases
  blue and downstream red, with the staggered overhang showing as
  different colours on the two strands.
- **200+ NEB enzymes** including Type IIS scanners; toggle restriction
  overlays with `r`, filter to unique cutters / 6+ bp / connectors.

### Edit
- **In-place sequence edits** with full undo / redo (50-deep snapshot
  stack, deepcopied SeqRecord). Per-plasmid undo stashes — switch
  records, edit, switch back, undo history is restored.
- **Feature CRUD**: add / merge / split / delete / rename / recolor
  features; clipboard copies (top strand or reverse-complement bottom
  strand). Mouse-drag selects ranges; `Enter` highlights the smallest
  feature enclosing the cursor.
- **Crash-recovery autosave** writes a 3-second-debounced `.gb`
  snapshot to the data dir; survivors surface on next launch.

### Cloning
- **Cloning grammars** — GB L0 (Esp3I) and MoClo Plant (BsaI) ship as
  built-ins; user-defined grammars persist to `cloning_grammars.json`
  and are editable in `GrammarEditorModal`. The active grammar
  parameterises the Domesticator, Parts Bin, and Constructor — change
  enzyme / overhang / forbidden-site set without code edits.
- **Domesticator** — 4-source part picker (current map, library,
  Parts Bin, FASTA file). Auto-scrubs forbidden Type IIS sites in the
  CDS body via codon swap with cascade-prevention; primer tails follow
  the active grammar's pad / site / spacer / overhang.
- **Parts Bin** — domesticated parts catalog with per-grammar filtering;
  legacy parts default to GB L0; "Copy primed sequence" preserves the
  part's stored grammar.
- **Constructor** — assembly UI for chaining L0 parts into a TU.
- **Primer design** — detection / cloning / Golden Braid / generic via
  Primer3; primers can be added to the map as `primer_bind` features
  or saved to the persistent primer library (Designed → Ordered →
  Validated lifecycle).

### Mutagenesis
- **SOE-PCR site-directed mutagenesis** — design 4-primer SOE sets for
  any W140F-style point mutation. CDS source can be the loaded plasmid,
  a library entry, a Parts Bin part, or a free-form protein sequence
  (auto-optimised via the active codon table). Edge cases (mutation
  within 60 nt of a CDS end) auto-fall back to a 2-primer modified-outer
  PCR.

### Search
- **In-process BLAST** (`Ctrl+B`):
  - **BLASTN** (DNA → DNA) and **BLASTP** (protein → protein) via
    `pyhmmer.hmmer.nhmmer` / `phmmer` (HMMER 3 in-process at C speed);
    pure-Python ungapped fallback for queries below the HMMER profile-
    builder minimum (20 bp / 6 aa).
  - **HMMscan** reads any HMMER 3 `.hmm` / `.h3m` / `.h3p` file
    directly — point it at Pfam-A or any custom profile DB. Lazy file
    read so Pfam-scale (~1 GB) DBs don't pre-fetch into RAM.
  - DB build + search run in a `@work(thread=True)` worker; UI stays
    responsive on a 50-plasmid index. 4-entry LRU DB cache, auto-
    invalidated on `_save_collections`.
- **Six-frame ORF indexing** (opt-in checkbox) for BLASTP against
  unannotated regions of plasmid backbones.
- **New Plasmid modal** (`Ctrl+N`) — paste a sequence, optionally name
  + set topology, then either Create / Annotate-from-library
  (substring match) / Annotate-via-BLAST (≥90% identity → `misc_feature`).

### Library
- **Plasmid collections** — named buckets (e.g. "yeast project",
  "E. coli toolkit"); the panel toggles between a collection list and
  the active collection's plasmids. Atomic writes, `.bak` per change.
  Save the loaded record with `Ctrl+Shift+A`.
- **Bulk import a folder** — from the collections-list view, click `+`,
  type a name, and pick a folder via the embedded directory tree.
  Every `.dna` / `.gb` / `.gbk` / `.genbank` file inside is loaded
  independently into a new collection; failures are isolated per file
  and surfaced in a notify summary. Designed for migrating a
  popular-commercial-plasmid-editor archive in one shot.
- **Library fuzzy search** — subsequence match (case-insensitive,
  non-contiguous) against the visible table.
- **Feature library** — reusable feature snippets (per-entry colour
  and strand) with a centralised browse / edit / rename / recolor /
  delete workbench.

### Drive it from outside the GUI
- **Agent API** (`splicecraft --agent-api`) exposes a localhost JSON
  API with bearer-token auth, covering every GUI action external AI
  agents need: get / set sequence, list features, add / update / delete
  features, export GenBank / FASTA, list library / collections, scan
  restriction sites, look up codon tables, optimize protein sequences,
  load files (chromosome-scale safe via the path-based loader).
- **`splicecraft-cli`** — stdlib-only sidecar (~50 ms cold start) that
  reads connection details from `~/.local/share/splicecraft/agent_token`
  and drives the running GUI. Intended for Claude Code, Cursor, aider,
  hand-rolled scripts, or any external automation.

## Installation

Requires **Python 3.10+** and a terminal of at least **100×30**.

### With pipx (recommended)

```bash
pipx install splicecraft
```

`pipx` installs SpliceCraft and its deps (Textual, Biopython,
primer3-py, platformdirs, pyhmmer) into an isolated virtual
environment and places the `splicecraft` command on your `PATH`. This
is the right approach on modern Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and WSL2,
where `pip install` into the system Python is blocked by
[PEP 668](https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/).

If you don't already have pipx:

```bash
sudo apt install pipx                # Debian / Ubuntu / WSL2
brew install pipx                    # macOS
python -m pip install --user pipx    # everywhere else
pipx ensurepath                      # one-time; adds ~/.local/bin to PATH
```

### With pip inside a venv

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/splicecraft
~/.venvs/splicecraft/bin/pip install splicecraft
~/.venvs/splicecraft/bin/splicecraft
```

(Plain `pip install splicecraft` into system Python works on older
distros and inside conda envs, but is rejected by PEP 668 on any
recent Debian-family system — use `pipx` or a venv instead.)

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Binomica-Labs/SpliceCraft.git
cd SpliceCraft
pip install -e .                     # inside a venv
```

### User data location

User data (collections, library, parts, primers, features, codon
tables, settings) lives in the platform-appropriate data directory:

| Platform | Path                                          |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Linux    | `~/.local/share/splicecraft/`                 |
| macOS    | `~/Library/Application Support/splicecraft/`  |
| Windows  | `%APPDATA%\splicecraft\`                      |

Override with `SPLICECRAFT_DATA_DIR=/path/to/dir splicecraft`.

## Data files

All user data persists as human-readable JSON in the user data
directory; every save is atomic and writes a `.bak` first.

| File                       | Purpose                                                  |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `collections.json`         | Named collections of plasmids — source of truth          |
| `plasmid_library.json`     | Live mirror of the active collection's plasmids          |
| `parts_bin.json`           | User-domesticated cloning parts                          |
| `primers.json`             | Designed primer library                                  |
| `features.json`            | Reusable feature snippets                                |
| `feature_colors.json`      | Per-type feature color overrides                         |
| `codon_tables.json`        | Cached codon-usage tables fetched from Kazusa            |
| `cloning_grammars.json`    | User-defined cloning grammars (Golden Braid / MoClo / custom) |
| `settings.json`            | App preferences (active collection, active grammar, …)   |
| `crash_recovery/*.gb`      | Per-record crash-recovery autosaves                      |
| `*.json.bak`               | Automatic backup — written before each save              |

The schema envelope (`{"_schema_version": 1, "entries": [...]}`)
silently accepts the legacy bare-list format (pre-0.3.1) and rewrites
it on the next save. Newer-version files load with a warning rather
than crashing.

---

## Tests

```bash
python3 -m pytest -n auto -q                  # full suite (~3 min on 8 cores)
python3 -m pytest tests/test_dna_sanity.py    # biology correctness only (< 2 s)
python3 -m pytest tests/test_invariants_hypothesis.py  # property-based fuzzing
```

All tests run offline against synthetic `SeqRecord`s and monkeypatched
data paths; an autouse fixture in `tests/conftest.py` guarantees no
test can write to real user files.

---

## Codebase tour

SpliceCraft is a single-file Python app (`splicecraft.py`,
~23,000 lines) on Textual + Biopython. The single-file layout is
intentional — no import puzzles, everything is greppable from one
place.

`grep -n "^class \|^def " splicecraft.py` gives an authoritative live
map. Test files are 1:1 named after the subsystem they cover.

`CLAUDE.md` at the repo root is the **agent + contributor handover
document**: ten sacred invariants, error-handling convention, known
pitfalls. Read it before touching the rendering layer, record pipeline,
or primer design.

---

## Maintenance

SpliceCraft is actively maintained. The maintainer is a practicing
bioengineer running real cloning workflows in it daily; releases
typically go out the same week a problem surfaces at the bench. Issues
and PRs welcome at
[github.com/Binomica-Labs/SpliceCraft/issues](https://github.com/Binomica-Labs/SpliceCraft/issues).

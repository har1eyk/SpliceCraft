# Features

What you can do without leaving the terminal.

## View

- **Braille dot-matrix circular maps** — plasmids rendered as crisp
  Unicode braille rings with per-strand feature arcs, directional
  arrowheads, and proximity-placed labels. `v` toggles linear view.
- **Per-base sequence panel** with two-strand display, wrap-aware
  feature lanes, restriction-site overlays, and inline AA translation
  (one letter per codon midpoint, in the CDS's colour, with wrap-CDS
  support across the origin). Click an AA letter to highlight the
  codon's three bases on the strand.
- **Per-strand restriction-cut visualisation** — clicking a sticky
  cutter (EcoRI, HindIII, BsaI, BsmBI, BbsI, …) tints upstream bases
  blue and downstream red, with the staggered overhang showing as
  different colours on the two strands.
- **200+ NEB enzymes** including Type IIS scanners; toggle restriction
  overlays with `r`, filter to unique cutters / 6+ bp / connectors.

## Edit

- **In-place sequence edits** with full undo / redo (50-deep snapshot
  stack, deepcopied SeqRecord). Per-plasmid undo stashes — switch
  records, edit, switch back, undo history is restored.
- **Feature CRUD**: add / merge / split / delete / rename / recolor
  features; clipboard copies (top strand or reverse-complement bottom
  strand). Mouse-drag selects ranges; `Enter` highlights the smallest
  feature enclosing the cursor.
- **Crash-recovery autosave** writes a 3-second-debounced `.gb`
  snapshot to the data dir; survivors surface on next launch.

## Cloning

- **Cloning grammars** — GB L0 (Esp3I) and MoClo Plant (BsaI) ship as
  built-ins; user-defined grammars persist to `cloning_grammars.json`
  and are editable in `GrammarEditorModal`. The active grammar
  parameterises the Domesticator, Parts Bin, and Constructor — change
  enzyme / overhang / forbidden-site set without code edits.
- **Domesticator** — 4-source part picker (current map, library,
  Parts Bin, FASTA file). Auto-scrubs forbidden Type IIS sites in the
  CDS body via codon swap with cascade-prevention; primer tails follow
  the active grammar's pad / site / spacer / overhang.
- **Parts Bin** — domesticated parts catalog with per-grammar filtering;
  legacy parts default to GB L0; "Copy primed sequence" preserves the
  part's stored grammar. **Load Part** auto-classifies the currently-
  open plasmid by digesting it with each grammar's Type IIS enzyme and
  matching the released fragment's overhangs against the grammar's
  position table — register an externally-domesticated part without
  manually picking grammar / position.
- **Constructor** — multi-tab assembly UI: Traditional restriction
  cloning, Golden Braid / MoClo Type IIS assembly, and **Gibson
  assembly**. The Gibson tab stages N linear fragments, detects the
  longest exact-match overlap at every junction (incl. the wrap
  junction for circular topology), validates against a configurable
  minimum, and produces a single assembled product with each overlap
  appearing once. Reverse-orientation fragments surface a "did you
  mean to flip" hint instead of silently failing.
- **Traditional cloning** — restriction-digest + ligation simulator
  with three insert sources (current plasmid, library entry, free-form
  PCR product). 2-enzyme directional cuts produce both forward and
  reverse-orientation products; non-ligatable orientations are flagged
  rather than silently dropped. Save the simulated product back to the
  library with full **construction-history XML** (`<HistoryTree>`
  matching the popular commercial editor's format) so the lineage of
  multi-step builds is preserved across import/export.

## Primer design

- **Primer design** — detection / cloning / Golden Braid / generic via
  Primer3; primers can be added to the map as `primer_bind` features
  or saved to the persistent primer library (Designed → Ordered →
  Validated lifecycle).

## Mutagenesis

- **SOE-PCR site-directed mutagenesis** — design 4-primer SOE sets for
  any W140F-style point mutation. CDS source can be the loaded plasmid,
  a library entry, a Parts Bin part, or a free-form protein sequence
  (auto-optimised via the active codon table). Edge cases (mutation
  within 60 nt of a CDS end) auto-fall back to a 2-primer modified-outer
  PCR.

## Simulate

- **In-silico PCR + agarose gel** (Simulator menu) — design a primer
  pair against the loaded plasmid and the simulator enumerates every
  legal amplicon (exact-match binding model, wrap-aware on circular
  templates, capped at 50 results to flag mispriming runaway).
  Amplicons round-trip to the library as linear DNA entries with
  `primer_bind` features at both ends.
- **Agarose gel renderer** — paint up to 8 lanes (ladder / uncut
  plasmid / restriction digest / PCR amplicon) on a virtual gel at
  user-selectable agarose % (0.5 → 4.0). Mobility uses the Helling-
  Goodman-Boyer empirical curve (distance ∝ −log₁₀ bp within each
  agarose's resolution window) plus the standard form corrections —
  supercoiled migrates faster than linear, nicked / open-circle
  slower. Lane sources share the screen's template, so the amplicon
  designed in the PCR tab is immediately runnable in the Gel tab.

## Search

- **In-process BLAST** (`Ctrl+B`):
  - **BLASTN** (DNA → DNA) and **BLASTP** (protein → protein) via
    `pyhmmer.hmmer.nhmmer` / `phmmer` (HMMER 3 in-process at C speed);
    pure-Python ungapped fallback for queries below the HMMER profile-
    builder minimum (20 bp / 6 aa).
  - **HMMscan** reads any HMMER 3 `.hmm` / `.h3m` / `.h3p` file
    directly — point it at Pfam-A or any custom profile DB. Lazy file
    read so Pfam-scale (~1 GB) DBs don't pre-fetch into RAM.
  - DB build + search run in a `@work(thread=True)` worker; UI stays
    responsive on a 50-plasmid index. 4-entry LRU DB cache, auto-
    invalidated on `_save_collections`.
- **Six-frame ORF indexing** (opt-in checkbox) for BLASTP against
  unannotated regions of plasmid backbones.
- **Cross-collection plasmid search** — Edit → Find plasmid… opens a
  fuzzy / substring search over every plasmid in every collection,
  natural-sorted by `(collection, plasmid)` so `pBin2` lands before
  `pBin10`. One click opens the entry without manually switching
  collections.
- **Pairwise alignment of sequencing runs** — File → Align sequencing
  run loads a Plasmidsaurus `.zip` (or any `.gbk` / `.gb`), pairwise-
  aligns it against the loaded plasmid, and renders a full-screen
  alignment viewer with target-feature lane, parallel target/query
  rows, match track, and mismatch-red highlighting. Length-capped at
  200 kb per side; cancellable via the standard worker pattern.
- **New Plasmid modal** (`Ctrl+N`) — paste a sequence, optionally name
  + set topology, then either Create / Annotate-from-library
  (substring match) / Annotate-via-BLAST (≥90% identity → `misc_feature`).

## Library

- **Plasmid collections** — named buckets (e.g. "yeast project",
  "E. coli toolkit"); the panel toggles between a collection list and
  the active collection's plasmids. Atomic writes, `.bak` per change.
  Save the loaded record with `Ctrl+Shift+A`.
- **Bulk import a folder** — from the collections-list view, click `+`,
  type a name, and pick a folder via the embedded directory tree.
  Every `.dna` / `.gb` / `.gbk` / `.genbank` file inside is loaded
  independently into a new collection; failures are isolated per file
  and surfaced in a notify summary. Designed for migrating a
  popular-commercial-plasmid-editor archive in one shot.
- **`.dna` round-trip.** SpliceCraft reads the popular commercial
  plasmid editor's binary format (sequence + features + notes +
  primers + construction history) and writes it back — including the
  default `Primers` and `AdditionalSequenceProperties` packets the
  editor itself emits — so files round-trip through SpliceCraft
  cleanly into the editor's Viewer / Inspector panels. Imported
  primers feed into the persistent primer library (de-duplicated by
  sequence), and per-feature colours are recovered alongside.
  Construction history XML is preserved on import and synthesised on
  save for any product built via the Traditional cloning simulator.
- **Construction history viewer.** `File → View construction history`
  renders any record's `<HistoryTree>` lineage — fragments, enzymes,
  parent products — as a navigable tree so the provenance of a
  multi-step build is auditable at a glance.
- **Library fuzzy search** — subsequence match (case-insensitive,
  non-contiguous) against the visible table; natural-sorted so
  `pBin2` lands before `pBin10`.
- **Feature library** — reusable feature snippets (per-entry colour
  and strand) with a centralised browse / edit / rename / recolor /
  delete workbench. Display rows natural-sort independently of the
  on-disk order so `pPart-2` sits next to `pPart-10` rather than
  scattered alphabetically; entry indices remain stable across the
  re-sort so dirty-edit markers don't desync.

## Drive it from outside the GUI

See [Agent API](agent-api.md) and [CLI sidecar](cli.md) for the
details. In short:

- **Agent API** (`splicecraft --agent`) exposes a localhost JSON API
  with bearer-token auth, covering every GUI action external AI
  agents need. 60+ endpoints; symlink-guarded write paths;
  length/range/shape validation at the boundary.
- **`splicecraft-cli`** — stdlib-only sidecar (~50 ms cold start)
  that reads connection details from the running session's token
  file. Intended for Claude Code, Cursor, aider, hand-rolled
  scripts, or any external automation.

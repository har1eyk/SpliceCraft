"""Release gate — every REQUIRED dependency must install from a WHEEL on
every supported platform × Python where its environment marker includes it.

Why this exists (2026-06-05): edlib sat in the required `dependencies`
with only a `sys_platform != 'win32'` marker, but edlib ships **no
Linux-aarch64 wheel**. So `pipx install splicecraft` on a 64-bit ARM
machine (Raspberry Pi, Graviton, ARM VM) had no wheel to use, fell back
to compiling edlib's C++ sdist, and failed on any box without a
toolchain — while `docs/PLATFORMS.md` promised a "clean pipx install".
A required dependency that can't install from a wheel anywhere in the
support matrix is an install-blocker; this gate makes that condition
fail the release instead of a user's machine.

Policy enforced: a dependency in `[project].dependencies` must resolve to
a wheel for every (platform, Python) its marker selects. A compiled
dependency that lacks universal wheels must either (a) carry a marker
that excludes the wheel-less platforms (and the code must degrade
gracefully there), or (b) move to an optional extra. Extras in
`[project.optional-dependencies]` are EXEMPT — they're opt-in and may
compile.

Run standalone: `python scripts/check_dep_wheels.py` (exit 1 on a gap).
Wired into `release.py` pre-flight. Needs network (queries PyPI via pip).
